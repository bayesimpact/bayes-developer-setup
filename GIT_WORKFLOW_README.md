# Git workflow at Bayes

<!-- TODO(cyrille): Fill this up. -->

## Reviews

Each PR should be requested for review to an engineer, ie a member of the [Software Engineers](https://github.com/orgs/bayesimpact/teams/software-engineers) team.

More people may be assigned to the review, but a requested reviewer needs to accept the PR (by replying with an LGTM emoji) before it can be merged.
